The Ethereum blockchain is a widely adopted global alternative to cloud computing platforms, currently used primarily for financial services. Given the large number of funds held by smart contracts and decentralized applications on top of Ethereum, there are profound security implications for both users and enterprise developers.

Over time, developers have brought more complex logic to Ethereum. For example, contracts often require access to valid, real-world data. In most cases, the system's functionality and security are strongly dependent on the correctness and safeness of the data pushed to the blockchain. One topic of this thesis is an oracle system---infrastructure added to the blockchain to respond to this need.
As contract code becomes more complex, it is increasingly likely that the code has bugs or vulnerabilities. Given smart contracts are immutable and tamper-proof, it seems impossible to upgrade a contract should a fix or patch be needed. Another topic of this thesis examines contract deployment patterns that enable and handle the upgradeability of smart contracts in Ethereum. Finally, the thesis also considers an application of oracle technology: payments made in stable currencies such as USD and not blockchain native currencies such as ETH, which are volatile in price. This thesis explains each topic in detail, evaluating the security risks of each, and examining any consequences for user trust and the degree of decentralization.

\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{chap:conclusion}

In this thesis, we presented an analysis of three Ethereum components---upgradeability, oracles, and stablecoins---which all add a degree of centrality. They each add trust points to an otherwise decentralized system, increasing the attack surface.

The main takeaways from measuring upgradeability on Ethereum (Chapter 3) is that immutability, as a core property of blockchain, is oversold. Also, we show that almost 64\% of smart contracts are in the control of a centralized agent who can decide to change the whole logic of the system. Future work on upgradability might examine our dataset to learn more about actual upgrade events that have happened on Ethereum. For instance, how many upgrades have happened, how frequently, and what can we determine about the reason behind the upgrade? Undisclosed security vulnerabilities could also be reverse-engineered from an upgrade serving as a security patch. 

The main takeaways from studying oracle systems on Ethereum (Chapter 4) is that most Ethereum projects depend on the data provided by Chainlink, which can be a single point of failure for the Ethereum ecosystem. It highlights a need to diversify which oracle services are used. We also point out that security is reduced to ensuring that the profit from corruption is less than the cost of corruption. Future work should examine how to capture the full extent of the potential profit, considering that attackers may profit outside of Ethereum by attacking oracles on Ethereum. It might conclude this can never be fully captured. 

The main takeways from enumerating the design space of Dai-like stablecoins (Chapter 5) is that they hide risk from the end-user or investor in complex ways that hard to analyze. There is also a prevailing idea that the choices made by MakerDao in designing Dai are the only way to make a stablecoin. We show that there are lots of other suitable designs with differing properties that deserve further research attention. It would also be helpful to have concrete results on the most suitable financial model for the ETH/USD exchange rate (\eg would drift-diffusion or GARCH work better?). Finally, is there a stablecoin design that would be more useful than Dai. Adding fungability to red coins (or CDPs/vaults in Dai) is the most interesting idea from our perspective.
