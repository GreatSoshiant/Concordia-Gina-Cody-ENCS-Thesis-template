The Ethereum blockchain is a widely adopted global alternative to cloud computing platforms, currently used primarily for financial services. Given the large number of funds held by smart contracts and decentralized applications on top of Ethereum, there are profound security implications for both users and enterprise developers.

Over time, developers have brought more complex logic to Ethereum. For example, contracts often require access to valid, real-world data. In most cases, the system's functionality and security are strongly dependent on the correctness and safeness of the data pushed to the blockchain. One topic of this thesis are oracles---infrastructure added to the blockchain to respond to this need.
As contract code becomes more complex, it is increasingly likely that the code has bugs or vulnerabilities. Given smart contracts are immutable and tamper-proof, it seems impossible to upgrade a contract should a fix or patch be needed. Another topic of this thesis examines contract deployment patterns that enable and handle the upgradeability of smart contracts in Ethereum. Finally, the thesis also considers an application of oracle technology: payments made in stable currencies such as USD and not blockchain native currencies such as ETH, which are volatile in price. This thesis explains each topic in detail, evaluating the security risks of each, and examining any consequences for user trust and the degree of decentralization.

\chapter{Conclusion and Future Works}
\label{chap:conclusion}

In this dissertation, we present an analysis of upgradeability, oracles, and stablecoins in the Ethereum blockchain, which are three components in Ethereum that add centrality by putting a trust point in the system and increasing the attack vectors of the decentralized applications ecosystem.

We describe six different patterns to add upgradeability features to immutable smart contracts and evaluate each method, to give the smart contract developers an insight into the pros and cons of each method. We prepared a dataset of upgradeable proxy contracts-- the most widely used upgrade pattern in Ethereum at the time. We also investigate the admin type of a dataset of upgradeable contracts. The main takeaway from studying upgradeability on Ethereum is that immutability, as a core property of blockchain, is oversold. Also, we show that almost 64\% of smart contracts are in the control of a centralized agent who can decide to change the whole logic of the system.

We also describe a specialized modular framework to analyze the oracle system in Ethereum. After our systematization, we claim that diversity in software promotes resilience in the system. Most Ethereum projects depend on the data provided by Chainlink oracle, which can be a single point of failure for the Ethereum ecosystem. There is a need to diversify the oracle systems. Also, we propose that to have a secure oracle, it should have a mechanism to ensure that the profit from corruption is lesser than the cost of corruption. Nevertheless, the problem is that one can never capture the full extent of the potential profit because attackers may profit outside of Ethereum by attacking oracles on Ethereum. 

Researching the stable coins shows how price changes on the underlying assets (\eg ETH) may negatively affect the stablecoin systems. A myriad of users who uses these stablecoins assumes that the price of stablecoins is stable. However, they do not know about the under the hood of the stablecoin systems and the risks regarding the price of the stablecoins. We also show a different design spectrum other than a liquidation to ensure that the stablecoin is pegged to a US dollar.

For future work, the dataset provided in our research can be used to show undiscovered facts about upgrade events in Ethereum. For instance, one can research the number of upgrades of the Dapps in Ethereum and investigate the reason behind upgrades. It may show a new way to find hacks or incidents that the developer team tried to hide. In oracle research, many theoretical vulnerabilities are proposed to different modules of oracles which one can research to show the effectiveness of each of the vulnerabilities. In stablecoin research, it would be helpful to have research results on the most suitable financial model for the ETH/USD price rate (\eg drift-diffusion or GARCH) for us to use. Future work could also examine the benefits of building a \dai alternative based on red-black coins but using different design parameters.
